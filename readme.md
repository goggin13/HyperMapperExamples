## HyperMapper Examples

This repository contains a few sample applications for the HyperMapper object document mapper gem.  

Full documentation for the gem itself can be found at the [HyperMapper Github Page](https://github.com/goggin13/HyperMapper).

Here is a (very) brief manifest of the directories here:

* HyperMapperDemo
  * The completed Rails application that is detailed in the [walkthrough tutorial](https://github.com/goggin13/HyperMapper/blob/master/tutorial.md).
* hyper_blog
  * similar to the app created in HyperMapperDemo, but more fleshed out.  Functions as relatively full featured blog (user accounts, authentication, commenting, etc.). 
* perf_hyper_mapper
  * the HyperMapper and Rails application used in our [performance tests](https://github.com/goggin13/HyperMapper/blob/master/stress_tests.md).
* perf_mongoid
  * the Mongoid and Rails application used in our [performance tests](https://github.com/gog* gin13/HyperMapper/blob/master/stress_tests.md).
* perf_logs
  * the raw results and graphs from the performance tests
* hyper_client_tests
  * some random test files that were used during development for reporting bugs with the Ruby HyperClient. 
* tasks
  * some commands that were used in the tutorial
